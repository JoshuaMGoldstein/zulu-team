✦ You've provided excellent clarification on your Cloud Run setup, and it indeed makes gcsfuse a perfectly
  viable and secure solution for your use case! The key points are:

   * Single User per Container: --concurrency=1 ensures one user per instance.
   * Session-Bound Mounts: The gcsfuse mount can be managed by a root websocket listener process for the
     lifetime of the connection.
   * Dynamic Credentials: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS can be passed dynamically per session.
   * Privilege Dropping: The Gemini CLI runs as a non-privileged user.
   * `--only-dir`: This is the core for restricting access to a specific subdirectory.

  This is a robust and secure architecture for your needs.

  To fully support the dynamic, user-specific subdirectory mounting, we need to make one final refinement to the
   container_entrypoint.sh script: it needs to receive the TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY dynamically, likely via an
  environment variable set by your proxy server when a user connects.

  Here's the updated container_entrypoint.sh script. I've changed APPUSER_MOUNT_POINT to /home/appuser/gcs_data
  to be more generic, as the specific subdirectory is now handled by gcsfuse --only-dir. The script will now
  expect an environment variable named GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT to specify which subdirectory to mount.

  Revised `container_entrypoint.sh`:

    1 #!/bin/bash
    2
    3 # This script runs as root initially to perform the gcsfuse mount.
    4
    5 GCS_BUCKET_ROOT="/gcs_mount_root" # This is where Cloud Run mounts the entire bucket
    6 # TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY will be passed via environment variable
    7 APPUSER_MOUNT_POINT="/home/appuser/gcs_data" # A generic mount point for the user
    8 NON_ROOT_USER="appuser"
    9 NON_ROOT_UID="1000"
   10 NON_ROOT_GID="1000"
   11
   12 echo "--- Container Entrypoint: Starting GCS FUSE mount ---"

   26 # --only-dir: Restricts the mount to only this subdirectory

✦ I have updated the container_entrypoint.sh script to dynamically receive the TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY via the
  GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT environment variable.

  Now, you will need to:

   1. Rebuild your Docker image:

   1     docker build -t gcsfuse-test /srv/s3fs
   2. Deploy to Cloud Run: When deploying your zulu-gemini-docker service to Cloud Run, you will need to pass
      the GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT environment variable. This variable will be set by your proxy server based on the
      connecting user.

      For example, if a user needs access to bot-instances/user_joshua, your proxy server would set
  GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT=bot-instances/user_joshua when it starts the Cloud Run instance (or sends the request that
   triggers a new instance).

      The gcloud run deploy command would look something like this (you'll need to adapt it to your specific
  deployment process):

    1     gcloud run deploy zulu-gemini-docker \
    2       --image gcr.io/your-project-id/gcsfuse-test \
    3       --platform managed \
    4       --region us-central1 \
    5       --execution-environment=gen2 \
    6       --concurrency=1 \
    7       --add-volume name=gcs-volume,type=cloud-storage,bucket=zulu-accounts-default-storage \
    8       --add-volume-mount volume=gcs-volume,mount-path=/gcs_mount_root \
    9       --set-env-vars GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT=bot-instances/user_joshua \
   10       # ... other deployment options
      Crucially, the `GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT` environment variable needs to be set dynamically by your
  proxy/orchestration layer when a user connects, not hardcoded in the `gcloud run deploy` command.

  This setup should provide the secure, user-specific, read-only access to GCS subdirectories that your Gemini
  CLI instance requires within Cloud Run.

  Do you have any further questions or need assistance with the Dockerfile or deployment commands?

   * Single User per Container: --concurrency=1 ensures one user per instance.
   * Session-Bound Mounts: The gcsfuse mount can be managed by a root websocket listener process for the

   * Dynamic Credentials: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS can be passed dynamically per session.
   * Privilege Dropping: The Gemini CLI runs as a non-privileged user.
   * `--only-dir`: This is the core for restricting access to a specific subdirectory.

  This is a robust and secure architecture for your needs. My apologies for the previous confusion regarding the
   interaction between Cloud Run's native volume mounts and a custom gcsfuse command. Your understanding is
  correct: if our script is responsible for the gcsfuse command, we should not use --add-volume and
  --add-volume-mount in the gcloud run services update command for the GCS bucket itself.

  The gcsfuse command in our script should mount the actual GCS bucket (e.g., zulu-accounts-default-storage)
  directly, using the --only-dir option to restrict the view.

  Here's the revised plan:

  1. Update Your Cloud Run Service to Use Second-Generation Runtime (Minimal)

  You will need to run the following gcloud command on your local machine (where gcloud is authenticated). This
  command will only set your zulu-gemini-docker service to use the second-generation execution environment,
  which provides the necessary FUSE capabilities. We will not add any GCS volume mounts here, as our script will
   handle that dynamically.

  Please run this command on your local machine:

   1 gcloud run services update zulu-gemini-docker \
   2   --project zulu-team-accounts \
   3   --execution-environment=gen2

  2. Modify Your Dockerfile and Create an Entrypoint Script

  After you've updated the Cloud Run service, we'll modify your Docker image. The container_entrypoint.sh script
   will run as root initially to perform the gcsfuse mount, and then it will drop privileges to your appuser for
   the actual CLI execution. The TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY will be passed dynamically via an environment variable.

  Revised `container_entrypoint.sh` (to be created in `/srv/s3fs`):

    1 #!/bin/bash
    2
    3 # This script runs as root initially to perform the gcsfuse mount.
    4
    5 # TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY will be passed via environment variable

    8 NON_ROOT_UID="1000"
    9 NON_ROOT_GID="1000"

   12 echo "--- Container Entrypoint: Starting GCS FUSE mount ---"
   13
   14 # Get the target subdirectory from an environment variable
   15 TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY="${GCS_SUBDIR_TO_MOUNT}"
   16 if [ -z "${TARGET_SUBDIRECTORY}" ]; then

   17 COPY container_entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/
   18 RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/container_entrypoint.sh
   19
   20 # Set the entrypoint to our custom script
   21 ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/container_entrypoint.sh"]
   22
   23 # Default command for the appuser (e.g., starting the Gemini CLI)
   24 CMD ["bash"]

  First, please run the `gcloud run services update` command from Step 1 on your local machine.

  Once that's done, let me know, and I will create the container_entrypoint.sh script and then provide the
  commands to update your Dockerfile and rebuild the image.
